    "### 1.1 Class\n",
    "* A class is a collection of objects, a user-defined **data structure**, which holds its own data members and member functions ***methods***\n",
    "* It contains the blueprints or the prototype from which the ***objects*** are being created.\n",
    "> A class **car** is supposed to be a collection of cars\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Object\n",
    "- An object is *“a thing from the real world”* of interest to the software application that we are building. \n",
    "- It is what you would want to store and process data about.\n",
    "- Also called as an entity or ***instance***. An object is created using a **class**\n",
    "> Your car is an object of the class car\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Attribute\n",
    "* All the information about the blueprint of a car is provided as ***attributes***\n",
    "> Your car has attributes make, model, year, mileage, color, brakes, alloys\n",
    "* Two types of attributes\n",
    "    * **Class attributes**: These attributes are the same for all the instances of class\n",
    "        > warranty is usually 3 yrs, emission standard in most cars is \"Euro 6\" etc\n",
    "    * **Instance attributes**: These attributes are specific for an instance & are NOT necessary for initialize a class instance\n",
    "        > In addition to those in __init__ method, color, alloys etc\n",
    "* Attributes can be hidden using `__hiddenVariable`. To access these hidden variables, use `class._class__hiddenVariable` or `instance._class__hiddenVariable`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Method\n",
    "* All the behavior/functionality of a class is called as a ***method***\n",
    "* Methods can manipulate object's attributes and provide the functionalities defined by the class\n",
    "> You can get the most recent driving info of your car, or start your car etc\n",
    "* ***DO NOT CONFUSE METHOD WITH A FUNCTION!!!*** A method is defined only for a class object while a function is defined for any variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.4.1 Constructor or Initialize method\n",
    "* Init method is called by default whenever you create an object from a ***class***\n",
    "* The variables passed into this `__init__` method and are necessary for any object of class car\n",
    "> A car must have a make, model, year although you can change its color, engine (mileage), brakes, alloys etc\n",
    "#### 1.4.2 Self\n",
    "* The term ***“self”*** refers to the instance of the class that is currently being used. It is basically a pointer to the class instance.\n",
    "* By using the “self”  we can access the attributes and methods of the class instance in Python.\n",
    "* `__init__` method is called when we create an instance and all the methods and attributes of this class instance are initialized"
